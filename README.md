# Blog

In this repository I will be writing my blog posts.

I am going to use the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## TODO List

- [ ] Add Dockerfile to build statics
- [ ] Create Makefile to build and push new version
- [ ] Create base hugo structure
- [ ] Tune theme
- [ ] Add old blog posts to it
