# Blog

In this repository I will be writing my blog posts.

I am going to use the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Emojis enabled

In the config.toml file I have enabled emojis. Check the [cheatsheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) 
to know how to add them.

## TODO List

- [ ] Update Makefile to deploy
- [ ] Add fontawesome to page for external links
- [ ] Add navigation bar as floating on the top
