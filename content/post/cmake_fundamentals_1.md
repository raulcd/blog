I first started working with CMake when I started working in the Arrow project a couple of
years ago. The Arrow project is known to be quite a complex project with lots of dependencies.
I started doing some fixes here and there to our CMake but I had to rely a lot on
other experts on the area due to my lack of knowledge.

This blog post, pretends to be the first on a series of blogposts where I plan to start
collecting some notes about my journey on a more formal and structured way of learning CMake
and its basics.

I am going to try to start with the basic concepts.

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform tool to manage the build process of your projects.

The file `CMakelists.txt` will contain the build configuration of your project. This file sits
along with your source files.

We will have both the source files and the build files. 
- Source files:
Those are the files under your control version system
- Build files:
Those files are generated by CMake and placed on the build directory. Those files
are platform dependendant. CMake also uses the term `binary` directory for the build directory.
Executables, libraries, test output and packages all are created on the build directory.
